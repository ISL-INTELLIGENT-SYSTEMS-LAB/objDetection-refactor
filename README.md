# Refactor/Rebase Efforts
A place for us to refactor for the code base and plan out its inner workings and how each function 
will work with each other (what data will be processed, the return values, documentation, variable naming, 
Level-2 Data flow diagram showing its inner workings, and a few other things). The sole reason we are 
performing this is to make the program more streamlined along with making it more understandable for people 
in the future when we inevitably pass it on.
